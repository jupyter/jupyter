Lo! We have listened to many a lay
Of the Spear-Danes' fame, their splendor of old,
Their mighty princes, and martial deeds!
Many a mead-hall Scyld, son of Sceaf,
Snatched from the forces of savage foes.
From a friendless foundling, feeble and wretched,
He grew to a terror as time brought change.
He throve under heaven in power and pride
Till alien peoples beyond the ocean
Paid toll and tribute. A good king he!

To him thereafter an heir was born,
A son in his halls whom heaven sent
To favor the folk, feeling their woe
That before had suffered without a leader
So long a time. The Lord endowed him,
The Wielder of Wonder, with world's renown.

Beowulf was famous—far flew the boast of him—
Son of old Scyld in the Scanian lands.
So should a youth by goodness of life
In his father's day win fame among men,
By liberal largess, so that in later years
When war assails him, his willing comrades
Will stand firm by him, and serve him in arms.
By worthy deeds in every folk
A man shall prosper.
