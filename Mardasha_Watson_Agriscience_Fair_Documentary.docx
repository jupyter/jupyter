# Introduction
doc.add_heading("Introduction", level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "This documentary explores the Agriscience Fair project conducted by Mardasha Watson. "
    "The purpose of the study was to determine whether natural fertilizers such as compost and manure "
    "could promote better plant growth than commercial synthetic fertilizers in tomato plants. "
    "The project aligns with the FFA Plant Systems category, focusing on sustainable agricultural practices "
    "and soil health improvement."
)

# Background Research
doc.add_heading("Background Research", level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Synthetic fertilizers are widely used in agriculture for quick nutrient availability, but they often lead to soil degradation "
    "and water pollution. Natural fertilizers, like compost and manure, are more sustainable alternatives that improve soil structure "
    "and support long-term fertility. Research from the USDA Sustainable Agriculture Program and the University of Florida’s IFAS Extension "
    "suggests that organic matter enhances soil health and moisture retention, though results vary based on soil and plant type."
)

# Hypothesis
doc.add_heading("Hypothesis", level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "If tomato plants are fertilized with natural compost, then they will grow taller and healthier than those fertilized with synthetic "
    "fertilizers because compost improves soil structure and retains nutrients longer."
)

# Experimental Design
doc.add_heading("Experimental Design", level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "The experiment involved growing twelve tomato plants under identical conditions, except for the type of fertilizer used. "
    "Four plants received compost, four received cow manure, and four were treated with a 10-10-10 synthetic fertilizer. "
    "All plants were watered equally, grown in the same soil type, and placed in similar sunlight conditions."
)

doc.add_paragraph(
    "Measurements of plant height and leaf count were taken twice a week for six weeks. Observations included plant color, stem thickness, "
    "and general health."
)

# Data and Observations
doc.add_heading("Data and Observations", level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Throughout the six-week period, tomato plants treated with compost consistently showed the best overall growth. "
    "By week six, compost-fertilized plants averaged 18 inches tall, manure-fertilized plants averaged 16 inches, "
    "and synthetic-fertilized plants averaged 15.5 inches. The compost plants also developed thicker stems and produced early flower buds."
)

# Data Table Summary
doc.add_paragraph("Summary of average results:")
table = doc.add_table(rows=1, cols=3)
hdr_cells = table.rows[0].cells
hdr_cells[0].text = 'Fertilizer Type'
hdr_cells[1].text = 'Average Final Height (inches)'
hdr_cells[2].text = 'Average Leaf Count'

data = [
    ('Compost', '18', '42'),
    ('Manure', '16', '38'),
    ('Synthetic', '15.5', '36')
]

for fert, height, leaves in data:
    row_cells = table.add_row().cells
    row_cells[0].text = fert
    row_cells[1].text = height
    row_cells[2].text = leaves

# Analysis
doc.add_heading("Data Analysis and Discussion", level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "The results supported the original hypothesis. Compost-fertilized plants grew the tallest and displayed the healthiest appearance. "
    "Manure-treated plants grew well initially but slowed down toward the end of the experiment, while synthetic fertilizer promoted fast early "
    "growth but weaker stems later on. These results suggest that compost provides more balanced and long-term nutrient availability."
)

# Conclusion
doc.add_heading("Conclusion", level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "The experiment demonstrated that natural compost fertilizer is an effective and environmentally friendly option for improving plant growth. "
    "It enhances soil quality, promotes sustainable agriculture, and can reduce the need for synthetic chemical inputs. "
    "This supports the growing movement toward more sustainable farming methods."
)

# Reflection
doc.add_heading("Reflection", level=2)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "Conducting this project helped develop scientific and agricultural research skills. Challenges included maintaining consistent watering "
    "and avoiding over-fertilization. These experiences taught the importance of careful observation and data recording in experiments."
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "This research connects directly to careers in agronomy, soil science, and environmental sustainability. "
    "It also reinforces the importance of innovation in agriculture to balance productivity with environmental care."
)
doc.add_paragraph(
    "The project is significant because it demonstrates how simple, natural methods can yield impressive results while protecting our planet’s resources."
