# Project Jupyter Documentation

Welcome to the Project Jupyter documentation site. Jupyter is a large umbrella
project that covers many different software offerings and tools, including the
popular [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) web-based
notebook authoring and editing applications. The Jupyter project and its
subprojects all center around providing tools (and [standards](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#sub-project-documentation))
for interactive computing with [computational notebooks](#what-is-a-notebook).

## What is a Notebook?

**Pictured:** *A computational notebook document, shown inside JupyterLab*

A notebook is a shareable document that combines computer code, plain language
descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and
figures, and interactive controls. A notebook, along with an editor (like
JupyterLab), provides a fast interactive environment for prototyping and
explaining code, exploring and visualizing data, and sharing ideas with
others.

## Where do I start?

Most people begin with Jupyter by installing an editing application that fits
their preferences, like [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
or [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
and making their first notebook document:

- Jupyter Notebook offers a simplified, lightweight notebook authoring experience
- JupyterLab offers a feature-rich, tabbed multi-notebook editing environment
  with additional tools like a customizable interface layout and system console
- And more... read about additional notebook interfaces [here](projects/user-interfaces)!

You can also develop your own extensions or applications on top of existing Jupyter
software. Check out the subproject sites below for more information.

These are a few high-level topics to help you learn more about the Jupyter community and ecosystem.

## Sub-project documentation

Individual sub-projects are typically organized around a key feature of the
Jupyter ecosystem, and have their own community, documentation and governance.
