"""A one-line description.

A longer description that spans multiple lines.  Explain the purpose of the
file and provide a short list of the key classes/functions it contains.  This
is the docstring shown when some does 'import foo;foo?' in IPython, so it
should be reasonably useful and informative.

# List all imports, sorted within each section (stdlib/third-party/ipython).
# For 'import foo', use one import per line.  For 'from foo.bar import a, b, c'
# it's OK to import multiple items, use the parenthesized syntax 'from foo
# import (a, b, ...)' if the list needs multiple lines.
# Separate stdlib, third-party, and IPython imports by a blank line.

# If a file is large and has many sections, you may want to use broad section
# headers like this one that make it easier to navigate the file,
# with descriptive titles.  For complex classes, simliar (but indented)
# headers are useful to organize the internal class structure.
