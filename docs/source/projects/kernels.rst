Kernels (Programming Languages)
===============================

The Jupyter team maintains the :ref:`IPython kernel <ipython_projects>`
since the Jupyter notebook server depends on the IPython :term:`kernel`
functionality. Many other languages, in addition to Python, may be used in
the notebook.

The community maintains many other language kernels, and new kernels become
available often. Please see the `list of available kernels`_ for additional
languages and `kernel installation instructions`_ to begin using these
language kernels.
