Kernels (Programming Languages)
===============================

The Jupyter team maintains the `IPython kernel <https://github.com/ipython/ipython>`_
since the Jupyter notebook server depends on the IPython :term:`kernel`
functionality. Many other languages, in addition to Python, may be used in
the notebook.

The community maintains many other language kernels, and new kernels become
available often. Please see the `list of available kernels`_ for additional
languages and `kernel installation instructions`_ to begin using these
language kernels.

Kernels
-------

Kernels are `programming language specific` processes that run independently
and interact with the Jupyter Applications and their user interfaces.
`IPython <https://ipython.org>`__ is the reference Jupyter kernel, providing a
powerful environment for interactive computing in Python.
