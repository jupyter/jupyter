Programming Languages (Kernels)
===============================

The IPython kernel is maintained by the Jupyter team since it is used in
the creation of the Jupyter notebook server.

There are many other language kernels that are maintained by the community.
A `list of available kernels <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages>`_.
and `installation instructions <https://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install/kernel_install.html>`_
contain links to the individual language kernels.
