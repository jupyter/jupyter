Project Jupyter is developed as a set of subprojects. The following is a topical
list of the officially supported and maintained subprojects with links to the
documentation or GitHub repo of each.



Jupyter user interfaces
-----------------------

The Jupyter user interfaces offer a foundation of interactive computing
environments where scientific computing, data science, and analytics can be
performed using a wide range of programming languages.


.. glossary::


    `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__
        Web-based application for authoring documents that combine live-code
        with narrative text, equations and visualizations.
        `Documentation <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ |
        `Repo <https://github.com/jupyter/notebook>`__


    `Jupyter Console <https://jupyter-console.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__

Kernels
-------

Kernels are `programming language specific` processes that run independently
and interact with the Jupyter Applications and their user interfaces. `IPython <https://ipython.org>`__ is the reference Jupyter kernel, providing a
powerful environment for interactive computing in Python.
