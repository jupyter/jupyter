"We support and encourage the translation of Jupyter documentation to "
"other languages as one way of making our community more inclusive and "
"diverse. We are working toward having a consistent model for translation "
"of Sphinx documentation across Jupyter projects based on prior work in "
"the Python and Django communities. This project "
"(https://jupyter.readthedocs.io) and the Jupyter Docker Stacks project "
