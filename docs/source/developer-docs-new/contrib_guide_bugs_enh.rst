Submitting a Bug
=================
While using the Notebook, you might experience a bug that manifests itself in 
unexpected behavior.  If so, we encourage you  to open issues on GitHub. To 
make the navigating issues easier for both developers and users, we ask that
you take the following steps before submitting an issue.

1. Search through StackOverflow and existing GitHub issues to ensure that 
   the issue has not already been reported by another user. If so, provide
   your input on the existing issue if you think it would be valuable.

2. Prepare a small, self-contained snippet of code that will allow others
   to reproduce the issue that you are experiencing.

3. Prepare information about the environment that you are executing the code
   in, in order to aid in the debugging of the issue. You will need to provide
   information about the Python version, Jupyter version, operating system,
   and browser that you are using when submitting bugs. You can also use
   ``pip list`` or  ``conda list`` and ``grep`` in order to identify the
   versions of the libraries that are relevant to the issue that you are
   submitting.

4. Prepare a simple test that outlines the expected behavior of the code
   or a description of the what the expected behavior should be.

5. Prepare an explanation of why the current behavior is not desired and 
   what it should be.
