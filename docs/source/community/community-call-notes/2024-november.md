## Purpose

Community calls provide a place for Jupyter community members to announce and share fun things that they're doing. We encourage brief (5 minutes or less) presentations with a demo or screen share, as needed. If you have a GitHub repo or demo web site, please share it! We recommend sharing open source or otherwise freely available work.


## Short reports, celebrations, shout-outs

This is a place to make short announcements (without a need for discussion). 

* **Jupyter Calendar** — All public community meetings can be found here. You are welcome to join to observe and participate. https://jupyter.org/community#calendar

## Agenda items
