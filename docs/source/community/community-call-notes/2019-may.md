## Welcome to the All-Jupyter Community Meeting

## Purpose

The purpose of these monthly video conference calls is to share and demonstrate the awesome things happening in Jupyter community. We invite **anyone** to present their work, engage in discussion, or just sit in and listen. Whether you have a new [lab extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab) you've created, a new [jupyterhub deployment](https://github.com/jupyterhub) you're excited about, or an [nteract papermill](https://github.com/nteract) pipeline powering your business, we'd love to hear about it! And, we'll  record and publish these calls on YouTube for anyone unable to attend.

For more discussion on the format of these calls, see the thread [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/reviving-the-all-jupyter-team-meetings/423).

## Short reports, celebrations, shout-outs

This is a place to make *short* announcements (without a need for discussion). This is also a great place to give shout-outs to contributors! Weâ€™ll read through these at the beginning of the meeting.

* Hello from [The Turing Way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) Book Dash :books::dash::dash: in London. This call is right at the end of a day of 18 people working together to improve the openly developed [Jupyter book](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/). Our goal is to make "Reproducibility too easy not to do" (:laughing::grimacing::scream_cat:), build a strong and supportive community, and give people the knowledge and confidence they need to contribute to open source projects  [name=Kirstie & Turing Way team]
