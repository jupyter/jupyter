## Short reports, celebrations, shout-outs, PR of the month

This is a place to make short announcements (without a need for discussion).

  * WIP PR to show a way forward to establish and maintain an accessibility roadmap for Sphinx-based documentation sites

* Check out @jtp's repos for [Jupyterlab-Classic](https://github.com/jtpio/jupyterlab-classic) and the [p5js notebook](https://github.com/jtpio/p5-notebook). I'm looking forward to sharing with students and teachers at Playfest conference in January. - _Carol_

* **WXYZDVCS** Work-in-progress report on [`wxyz.dvcs`](https://github.com/deathbeds/wxyz), a bridge from Jupyter Widgets to distributed version control - _Nick_
  * _Hopefully_ released this week 🤞, [![][binder]](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/deathbeds/wxyz/master?urlpath=lab/tree/src/py/wxyz_notebooks/src/wxyz/notebooks/index.ipynb) works though!
* Pierre's notebooks for teaching Python and data science
* [JupyterLab Classic](https://github.com/jtpio/jupyterlab-classic) - *Jeremy*
