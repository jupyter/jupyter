## Purpose

Think of it as a monthly, virtual JupyterCon. Itâ€™s a place to announce and share fun things happening in the Jupyter community.

For more discussion on the format of these calls, see the thread [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/reviving-the-all-jupyter-team-meetings/423).

## Short reports, celebrations, shout-outs

This is a place to make short announcements (without a need for discussion). 

* **Zach** [voila-gridstack](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-gridstack) is great and Zach can't wait for a release on PyPI sometime soon!

## Agenda Items

With time changes, this meeting was accidentally double-booked with the Jupyter Security meeting! Since we had an open agenda before the community call, our notes overlap with theirs.

For notes from this call, please refer to the [March 29, 2022 jupyter/security meeting notes!](https://github.com/jupyter/security/tree/main/meetings/2022-03-29.md)
