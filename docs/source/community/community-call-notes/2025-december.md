## Purpose

Think of it as virtual JupyterCon. It’s a place to announce and share fun things happening in the Jupyter community.

For more discussion on the format of these calls, see the thread [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/jupyter-community-calls/668/107).

## Short reports, celebrations, shout-outs

This is a place to make community announcements (without a need for discussion).

* If you have any links for JupyterCon retrospectives/posts it would be nice to share them here
