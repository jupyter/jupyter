Community Call Notes
====================

The Jupyter Community Call is an open video call. Think of this as a "monthly, virtual JupyterCon". It's a place for *anyone* to announce and share fun things happening in the Jupyter community. Everyone is welcome (even if you're not presenting). We record these videos and post them on YouTube. For more information, `read this discourse thread <https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/all-jupyter-community-calls/668>`__.
