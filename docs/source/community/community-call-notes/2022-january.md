**Please note:**
- Community calls are recorded and posted to this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUrHeD2K9Cmkoamm4NjLmvXC4Y6E1o8SP)
- These notes will be recorded and posted [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/community-call-notes/index.html)
- Everyone present is held to the [Jupyter Code of Conduct](https://jupyter.org/conduct)

## Purpose

Think of it as a monthly, virtual JupyterCon. Itâ€™s a place to announce and share fun things happening in the Jupyter community.

For more discussion on the format of these calls, see the thread [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/reviving-the-all-jupyter-team-meetings/423).

## Short reports, celebrations, shout-outs

This is a place to make short announcements (without a need for discussion). 

* Zach has a shout out! Hooray for these calls continuing into 2022!
* Tony: congrats to the team who made the first two Jupyter accessibility workshops happen in the last two weeks
* Steve: Shout out to Zach for being an early adopter of the new Jupyter governance process with jupyter-server!
* Tony: Shout out to Darian for sharing the Jupyter governance process changes with the whole community
* Tony: Great work to the Binder team for keeping Binder ready to go for the world.
* Tony: Thanks to everyone attending for keeping community calls running
* Zach: Cool demo on Twitter of MyST in a Jupyter notebook (this is later on the agenda)

## Agenda Items

* **MLflow Kernel Demo** by Jitendra Pandey (jitendra@infinstor.com). MLflow Kernel connects to an MLflow service and records all the data science activities in the Jupyter notebook as MLflow artifacts. It is open source at [infinstor/mlflow-kernel](https://github.com/infinstor/mlflow-kernel) and [Infinstor quickstart: mlflow kernel](https://www.infinstor.com/quickstart/mlflow-kernel.)
* Demonstrations of [Jupyter cache](https://jupyter-cache.readthedocs.io), [JupyterLab MyST](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyterlab-myst) (and maybe [PR to rewrite myst-nb](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-NB/pull/380))
