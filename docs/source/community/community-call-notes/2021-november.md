## Purpose

Think of it as a monthly, virtual JupyterCon. Itâ€™s a place to announce and share fun things happening in the Jupyter community.

For more discussion on the format of these calls, see the thread [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/reviving-the-all-jupyter-team-meetings/423).

## Short reports, celebrations, shout-outs

This is a place to make short announcements (without a need for discussion). 

* **@loichuder:** Release 1.0.0 of [jupyterlab-h5web](https://github.com/silx-kit/jupyterlab-h5web) bringing support for JLab3 as prebuilt extension ðŸŽ‰
* **@bollwyvl** `jupyterlite 0.1.0a17` speaks self-hosted/custom wheels and MathJax
  * [offline pyodide](https://jupyterlite--425.org.readthedocs.build/en/425/_static/lab/index.html) coming
    * [jupyter-server-proxy 3.2.0](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#320---2021-11-29) including full control of request re-writing, sub-paths in Lab launchers 

## Agenda Items

* **@ltetrel** jupyter book workflow on [NeuroLibre](https://www.neurolibre.org/)
    * [NeuroLibre Documentation](https://docs.neurolibre.org/en/latest/) (you are welcome to be an alpha tester!))
    * This is the [pull request for initContainer on binderhub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1081). It should be already possible with [Zero to JupyterHub singleuser.initContainers](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources/reference.html#singleuser-initcontainers) but not optimal (better to do our process once during build). The missing piece is to give that initContainer an environment variable ([as discussed on the github issue](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/issues/1429) and [Jupyter discourse](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/feature-idea-jupyterhub-binderhub-jupyter-book-as-a-publishing-platform/8359/8?u=ltetrel)).
* **@fcollonval** [WIP RISE in JupyterLab PR](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE/pull/605)

  To test the PR locally, here are the commands to execute:
  ```sh
    yarn 
    yarn build
    python3 -m pip install -e .
    jupyter server extension enable --sys-prefix rise
    jupyter serverextension enable --sys-prefix rise
    jupyter labextension develop --overwrite .
  ```

* **@afshin** `[DRAFT]` Jupyter Enhancement Proposal (JEP) for [Jupyter Notebook version 7](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals/pull/79)
    * Also mentioned on the [Jupyter Discourse](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/jep-draft-open-for-the-notebook-v7-transition/11769)

## Comments

- Gabriel: being able to draw on the slides in Frederic's demo (over the figures, charts) looked very cool to me
