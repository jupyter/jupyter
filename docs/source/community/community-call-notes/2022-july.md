## Purpose

Think of it as a monthly, virtual JupyterCon. Itâ€™s a place to announce and share fun things happening in the Jupyter community.

For more discussion on the format of these calls, see the thread [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/reviving-the-all-jupyter-team-meetings/423).

## Agenda Items

* **Isabela** Favorite community call memories/what you want next
    * Demos of work people are building on top of Jupyter (but not sales pitches)
    * "Pie"
    * Themes for calls!
    * Lightning talk length of share (right now we have one minute or ten)
    * "live demos are always good even if they're incomplete"
    * "I'd like people to report a new thing they learned "today I learned" using a Jupyter notebook recently"
    * Sign up sheet to mix up hosts! Good for everyone to get experience and can bring in new energy.
    * Recognize testers 
    * Once a quarter: "here's four ways you can contribute" as a recurring topic so people get reminded and don't have to watch the back catalog to hear it (or a list of projects to contribute to)
