## Purpose

Think of it as a monthly, virtual JupyterCon. It‚Äôs a place to announce and share fun things happening in the Jupyter community.

For more discussion on the format of these calls, see the thread [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/reviving-the-all-jupyter-team-meetings/423).

## Short reports, celebrations, shout-outs

This is a place to make short announcements (without a need for discussion). 

* **Fr√©d√©ric Collonval** To improve visibility and group volunteer time on maintenance of popular JupyterLab 
extensions, a unofficial GitHub organization has been created: [jupyterlab-contrib](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib).
* **Isabela Presedo-Floyd** In case you missed it, [JupyterLab 3.0 is out](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-3-0-is-out-4f58385e25bb)! Congrats to the community and thanks for all 
the hard work that went into this release.
* **Isabela Presedo-Floyd** I've seen a resurgence of community interest in making multiple Jupyter projects accessible.
This is awesome! We also have a group of people meeting every other week to coordinate JupyterLab accessibility work (and 
talk about accessibility in general) that you can join from the [community calendar](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html#jupyter-community-meetings).
* **Layne Sadler** Plotly updated jupyter-dash labextension for 3.0 and vows to prebuild. [issue](https://github.com/plotly/jupyter-dash/issues/49)

## Agenda Items

* **Nick Bollweg** [jupyterlab-lsp 3.2](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-lsp/) on `pypi` & `conda-forge`. JupyterLab
:three:. :eight: _[Language Client](https://langserver.org)_ features. Ju(lia)+Py(thon)+R _Language Servers_+_Kernel_+_Notebook_, 
plus [more](https://jupyterlab-lsp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Language%20Servers.html). [Pre-JEP Issue](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals/issues/67)
to move towards an official sub-project üöÄ.
* **Nick Bollweg** (_or someone better :muscle:_) [JupyterLab 2.3.0rc0](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blame/2.3.x/docs/source/getting_started/changelog.rst#L6-L12)
is a performance-focused prerelease, on `pypi`/`conda-forge`, these features will land in 3.1. Ready for
[testing](https://github.com/robots-from-jupyter/robotframework-jupyterlibrary/pull/34)!
* **Fr√©d√©ric Collonval**: Leverage JupyterLab modularity to customize the UI with a alternative 
[launcher](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jlab-enhanced-launcher) and a [cell toolbar](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jlab-enhanced-cell-toolbar) - demonstrate easier distribution thanks to JLab3.
* **Corentin Cadiou**: presentation of [ipysphaghetti](https://github.com/cphyc/node_editor) (name not settled yet) a JLab 
(3+) extension implementing a node-based approach to interact with your data.
* **Thorin Tabor:** Notebook Projects, a mechanism for encapsulating multiple user environments in a JupyterHub instance

## Q/A

> **As a company, how do we start contributing?**
> - @willingc follow the projects that seem most within your team's wheelhouse
>   - Visit the Jupyter [Discourse](https://discourse.jupyter.org/) and [community calendar](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/jupyter-community-calendar/2485)!
> - @jasongrout JupyterLab [4.0 release plans](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/9647) are underway. There may be items there, or things you want to contribute.
>   - translations always welcome! Check [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/jupyterlab) for more info.
>   - [corporate guidance](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/master/CORPORATE.md)
>   - [team compass](https://github.com/jupyterlab/team-compass) is where many of these larger discussions may happen.
> - @jupyter/notebook is very starved for resources
>   - has a weekly meeting just trying to keep the issue count down.
>     - many are low-touch to at least get triaged
>   - really any help welcome
> - @isabela-pf accessibility on all projects.
>   - We have been starting with JupyterLab Components, etc. Notes for our meetings and all current team work live in [this issue](https://github.com/jupyterlab/team-compass/issues/98)
>   - And documentation in [pydata-sphinx-theme](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/294)  (upstream of `jupyter-book`, etc.)
