## Purpose

Think of it as a monthly, virtual JupyterCon. Itâ€™s a place to announce and share fun things happening in the Jupyter community.

For more discussion on the format of these calls, see the thread [here](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/reviving-the-all-jupyter-team-meetings/423).

## Short reports, celebrations, shout-outs

This is a place to make short announcements (without a need for discussion).
