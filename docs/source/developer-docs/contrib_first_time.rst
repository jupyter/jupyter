Welcome fellow contributor! We appreciate your help.

We typically label issues appropriate for new contributors as ``good first
issue`` or ``help wanted``.  To start an issue, you may comment to let everyone
know that you'll be working on it.  Our repos typically provide development
installation instructions in each repo's ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` or ``README.md``.
**Should you find an issue with our development installation instructions please
let us know in our issues.**  We want to ensure that our documentation for
development installation is accurate.  Additionally, other contributors are
often available to answer questions about fixing the issue on the issue number
or on the repo's gitter channel.

We strive to have a inclusive, welcoming community.  Please read our `code of
conduct <https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md>`__
to learn more.
