Try in Your Browser. No Installation Needed.
============================================

*Try Jupyter* (https://try.jupyter.org) is a site for trying out the Jupyter Notebook,
equipped with kernels for several different languages (Julia, R, C++, Scheme, Ruby)
without installing anything. You will also find there an example to try out the new
JupyterLab interface.

When running the examples on the `Try Jupyter` site, you will get a temporary Jupyter
server running on mybinder.org which you can use to play around until you close your
browser session.

The *Classic Notebook* example should look like this:
