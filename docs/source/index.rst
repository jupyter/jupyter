===========================
Project Jupyter and IPython
===========================

Welcome to the **Project Jupyter and IPython** "official" documentation
landing page.

**What is Project Jupyter?** Project Jupyter was born out of the IPython
Project in 2014 as the project evolved to support interactive data science
and scientific computing across all programming languages.

The popular **Jupyter Notebook** (formerly IPython notebook) provides a
web-based application for authoring engaging documents combining live-code
with narrative text, equations, images, video, and visualizations. By
encoding a complete and reproducible record of a computation, the documents
can be shared with others on GitHub, Dropbox, and
the `Jupyter Notebook Viewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/>`__.
