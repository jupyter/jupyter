Project Jupyter
===============

Welcome to **Project Jupyter's "official" documentation landing page**. From
this page, you may access all "official" documentation for Project Jupyter and
IPython projects.

**What is Project Jupyter?** Project Jupyter was born out of the IPython
Project in 2014 as the project evolved to support interactive data science
and scientific computing across all programming languages. The popular
Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython notebook) is a cornerstone of the project.


Jupyter Notebook Quickstart
---------------------------
The Jupyter Notebook is a web application for interactive data science and
scientific computing. Using the Jupyter Notebook, you can author engaging
documents that combine live-code with narrative text, equations, images, video,
and visualizations. By encoding a complete and reproducible record of a
computation, the documents can be shared with others on GitHub, Dropbox, and
the `Jupyter Notebook Viewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/>`__.
