Project Jupyter and IPython
===========================

Welcome to **Project Jupyter and IPython** "official" documentation landing
page. From this page, you may access all "official" documentation for Project
Jupyter and IPython projects.

**What is Project Jupyter?** Project Jupyter was born out of the IPython
Project in 2014 as the project evolved to support interactive data science
and scientific computing across all programming languages. The popular
**Jupyter Notebook** (formerly IPython notebook) is a cornerstone of the project.
Using the Jupyter Notebook, you can author engaging documents that combine
live-code with narrative text, equations, images, video,
and visualizations. By encoding a complete and reproducible record of a
computation, the documents can be shared with others on GitHub, Dropbox, and
the `Jupyter Notebook Viewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/>`__.
