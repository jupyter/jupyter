Jupyter Documentation
=====================

The Jupyter Notebook is a web application for interactive data science and
scientific computing. Using the Jupyter Notebook, you can author engaging
documents that combine live-code with narrative text, equations, images, video,
and visualizations. By encoding a complete and reproducible record of a
computation, the documents can be shared with others on GitHub, Dropbox, and
the `Jupyter Notebook Viewer <https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer>`__.


The main documentation for Jupyter is organized into several sections:

* :ref:`user-docs`
* :ref:`jupyter-subprojects`
* :ref:`about-docs`

Information about development is also available:

* :ref:`dev-docs`
